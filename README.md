Here's a detailed README.md draft based on analysis of your GitHub repo: Skill Swap Platform and the live site kamatech.odoo.com:

💡 Skill Swap Platform
Welcome to the Skill Swap Platform – a collaborative mini-application that empowers users to exchange skills with one another. Built using a dynamic front-end and integrated with Odoo backend services, the platform simplifies finding, offering, and requesting skills in your community.

🔗 Live Demo: kamatech.odoo.com

📦 Project Structure
This repository contains the frontend UI code and basic setup logic for the Skill Swap Platform. The platform connects to Odoo for backend services such as user profiles, skill listings, swap requests, and more.

Key Features
👤 User Profile Creation – Add name, location, contact info, skills offered, and skills wanted.

🔁 Skill Swap Matching – Users can view and request swaps based on mutual skill needs.

📜 Dynamic Listings – All profiles and requests are updated automatically and shown on the home page.

🌐 Responsive UI – Works on mobile and desktop.
